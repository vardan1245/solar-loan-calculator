# 12Y Warranty Migration Verification Checklist

## 🎯 Migration Status: ✅ COMPLETED

Your database has been successfully updated from `profit_per_kw_10Y` to `profit_per_kw_12Y`!

## ✅ What's Working

1. **Database Updated**: `profit_per_kw_10Y` → `profit_per_kw_12Y`
2. **API Endpoint**: `/api/system-cost-settings` returns 12Y data
3. **Server Running**: Node.js server is active on port 3001
4. **Frontend Updated**: All HTML files show "12 Years" instead of "10 Years"
5. **Backend Logic**: Server recognizes `_12Y` keys correctly

## 🔍 Verification Results

### Database Check ✅
- `profit_per_kw_12Y` exists with ID 664
- Value: 30,000 AMD (correct)
- All warranty periods present: 2Y, 3Y, 6Y, 12Y

### API Check ✅
- `/api/system-cost-settings` returns profit margins
- 12Y warranty data is included in the response
- No database connection errors

### Frontend Check ✅
- HTML shows "12 Years" option
- Default warranty period is 12 years
- All conditional logic updated to use 12Y

## 🚨 Minor Issue Found

**Description Field**: The 12Y warranty record still has the old description "Profit per kW for 10-year warranty period"

**Fix**: Run this SQL command:
```sql
UPDATE system_cost_settings 
SET description = 'Profit per kW for 12-year warranty period'
WHERE category = 'profit_margin' AND warranty_years = 12;
```

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### 1. Test Warranty Dropdown
- [ ] Open http://localhost:3001
- [ ] Check warranty dropdown shows "12 Years"
- [ ] Verify "12 Years" is selected by default

### 2. Test Loan Calculation
- [ ] Enter system power (e.g., 10 kW)
- [ ] Select 12 Years warranty
- [ ] Verify no "Profit value not found" errors
- [ ] Check that profit calculations work

### 3. Test All Warranty Options
- [ ] Test 2 Years warranty
- [ ] Test 3 Years warranty  
- [ ] Test 6 Years warranty
- [ ] Test 12 Years warranty
- [ ] Verify all work without errors

## 📊 Expected Results

### Warranty Dropdown
- Should show: 2 Years, 3 Years, 6 Years, 12 Years
- Default selection: 12 Years

### Profit Calculations
- 2 Years: 15,000 AMD/kW
- 3 Years: 20,000 AMD/kW
- 6 Years: 25,000 AMD/kW
- 12 Years: 30,000 AMD/kW

### No Errors
- No "Profit value not found" messages
- No database connection errors
- All warranty options work correctly

## 🔧 If Issues Persist

### Check Browser Console
- Look for JavaScript errors
- Check network requests to `/api/system-cost-settings`
- Verify data is being fetched correctly

### Check Server Logs
- Look for database connection errors
- Check if API endpoints are responding
- Verify data structure in responses

### Database Verification
```sql
-- Check profit margins
SELECT warranty_years, profit_per_kw, name 
FROM system_cost_settings 
WHERE category = 'profit_margin' 
ORDER BY warranty_years;

-- Check specifically for 12Y
SELECT * FROM system_cost_settings 
WHERE category = 'profit_margin' AND warranty_years = 12;
```
